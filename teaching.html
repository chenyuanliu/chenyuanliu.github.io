  		<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>
<p> I have worked as teaching assistant in six semesters for three different courses: the core Business Analytics courses for BBA students and Principles of Risk Management. In each course, I prepared and led discussion sessions, and designed and graded homework. The courses are described below. </p>
		
<h2>Business Analytics I </h2>
	<p>Distinguished Teaching Award, 2016. Wisconsin School of Business.
	<p>Teaching assistant to <a href="https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/bavafa/teaching?authuser=0" target="_blank">Hessam Bavafa</a>, Richard Crabb, Paul Johnson, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/amukherjee/" target="_blank">Anita Mukherjee</a>.</p>
	<p>The learning objectives of the course are for students to (1) acquire “statistical literacy,” meaning that they can interpret statistics frequently used in current events, industry reports, and so on; (2) distinguish between descriptive and inferential statistics, and apply skills such as data summarization, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis, using Excel; (3) apply the core concepts of probability to decision-making under uncertainty, including an introduction to simulation; (4) synthesize their knowledge with quantitative business cases; and; (5) effectively communicate data analyses in written, visual, and oral formats. </p>		
<h2>Business Analytics II </h2>
	<p>Teaching assistant to Sung Kim and Michael Hernke
	<p>This course provides students with hands-on experience with many commonly used analytic methodologies using the modeling and optimization tools available on almost every professional desktop, namely Microsoft Excel and Access. The course focus on predictive and prescriptive analytics. Predictive approaches use historical data to infer relationships and forecast future outcomes from a given action. Prescriptive methods take this a step further, helping managers formulate decision models that identify optimal actions given a set of circumstances. Topics covered: linear regression, logistic regression, model building, time series forecasting, optimization modeling, simulation, database.</p>
<h2>Principles of Risk Management</h2>
	<p>Teaching assistant to Joan Schmit. <a href="https://wsbfiles.wsb.wisc.edu/digital/jtschmit/schteach/RMI%20300%20Syllabus%20F2018%20requirements-1.pdf" target="_blank">[Syllabus]</a></p>
	<p>The course covers advanced work in insurance; the nature of risk, principal techniques of risk management and the bases for decision making in the management of the business and personal risks. The learning objectives of the course are for students to (1) recognize the general types and characteristics of situations involving risk, how to identify them, and why they are important; (2) possess the skills and knowledge to measure and assess risk; (3) know the basics of how RM tools work and their benefits/costs in any given situation; (4) be able to apply the RM process in a simple situation involving risk; (5) explain the value that sound risk management provides individuals, organizations, society.</p>
