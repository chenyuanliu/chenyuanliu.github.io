  		<h2>Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>
  			<p>This paper identifies an underappreciated dimension of sorting in health insurance: sorting by plan design. Health insurance plans often have multi-dimensional cost-sharing attributes that can vary across plans with the same expected level of coverage. Classic theory suggests that plans with optimal risk protection have a straight-deductible design. I show that under community-rated prices, only high-risk types will sort into such plans. The low-risk types will prefer plans that trade-off higher maximum out of pocket (MOOP) for lower deductibles because, holding fixed the premium level, such plans provide more expected coverage to them (but also more variance in out-of-pocket expenditure). </p>
			<p>Consistent with theory, I find that ACA markets a) are populated with plans with very different levels of risk protection within the same coverage tier and b) high MOOP plans appear to attract healthier enrollees. I discuss conditions under which regulations to standardize plans will improve welfare, and I estimate the potential benefits of such policies. </p>
