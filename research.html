  		<h2>Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>
			<p> Draft: <a href= "https://chenyuanliu.github.io/files/DesignSorting_ChenyuanLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[Mar 2021]</a> <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSI4URrvsC4&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">[Video Presentation] </a></p>
  			<p>Should health insurance plans be standardized? This paper explores both theoretically and empirically the implications of allowing multiple cost-sharing attributes for the functioning of health insurance markets. I develop a model of insurance choice with contracts varying in both the coverage level and the variance of uninsured losses. The model predicts that under asymmetric information, individuals with different health risks will demand plans with different designs, generating a force for plan variation even in markets that regulate the average level of coverage. I test for this type of selection on plan design in the ACA Exchange and find that a) cost-sharing variations within coverage tiers create significant differences in the risk protection to consumers and b) consumers sort differentially by health status in ways consistent with the theoretical predictions. I show that the consequences of regulating away design variation within coverage tiers depend on the extent of risk adjustment regulations and consumer confusion in the market. </p>

		<h2>Dominated Options in Health-Insurance Plans</h2>

		<p> Prior research documents that there are sometimes dominated options in health plan menus, but is that common? We analyze Kaiser Family Foundation data on health plans that firms offer to their employees. For firms offering both a high-deductible and lower-deductible health plan, 62% of the time the high-deductible option has lower maximum spending risk for the employee. We estimate that the high-deductible plan dominates at roughly half of firms. We discuss potential mechanisms behind these surprising patterns and find support both for two explanations: widespread adverseselection pricing and some employers also differentially favoring high-deductible plans.  </p>

		<h2>Financial Incentives and Physician Treatment Decisions: Evidence from Lower Back Pain</h2>

		<p> Draft: <a href= "https://chenyuanliu.github.io/files/CapitationLBP_DingLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[Jan 2021]</a></p>
		<p> In response to the high cost of health care, the capitated payment model has become more popular in recent years. Under capitation, physicians are compensated a fixed amount per patient regardless of the services generated. We provide new evidence on how the capitation payment model changes physician behavior by studying the treatment of lower back pain, a treatment type that has a lot of leeway for physicians’ discretion. We use data from 2003 to 2006 from a large employer-sponsored health insurance claim database, and we leverage capitation variation within the plan and physician to mitigate selection concerns and isolate impacts from other supply-side cost containment strategies. We find that the treatment intensity—mainly from therapy, diagnostic testing, and drugs—of patients under a capitation system is 12% lower than otherwise similar patients in a non-capitated plan. We also find no evidence of increased readmission rates for patients in a capitated plan. </p>

		<h2>Does Allowing Greater Health Plan Variety Increase Enrollment? Evidence from the ACA Actuarial Value Rule Change</h2>
		<p> with Thomas DeLeire</a>. </p>
		<p> The 2017 Market Stabilization Rule changed the de minimus range in actuarial value (AV) of most plans offered on the individual market from -2/+2 percentage points to -4/+2 percentage points. In 2018 and 2019, Marketplace plans in states using the HealthCare.gov platform reflected this expanded AV range, with almost 25% of plans having AVs more than 2 percentage points below their target AV. These lower AV plans had correspondingly lower premiums, and each percentage-point decline in AV was associated with a $5.70 lower premium for a 27-year-old non-smoker. AVs of Benchmark plans also declined, leading to a $1.41 decline in the Benchmark premium and $1.12 decline in the average premium subsidy for each percentage-point decline in the AV of the Benchmark plan. There were greater declines in enrollment in areas and among insurance products that used the expanded AV range to a greater extent, and most of these enrollment declines were the result of reductions in premium subsidies. Our estimates imply that eliminating this rule would lead to increased benchmark premiums, premium tax credits, and Marketplace enrollment. </p>
