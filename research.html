  		<h2>(Job Market Paper) Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>
			<p> <a href= "chenyuanliu.github.io/files/DesignSorting_ChenyuanLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[Draft Nov 2019]</a> </p>
  			<p>It is well known that under asymmetric information, adverse selection can lead to distortions in the level of insurance coverage purchased. This paper identifies an understudied dimension of sorting in insurance: sorting by plan design. In many markets, insurance plans have multi-dimensional cost-sharing attributes that can vary across plans with the same expected level of coverage. Classic theory suggests that plans with optimal risk protection have a straight-deductible design. I show that under asymmetric information, only high-risk individuals sort into such plans. Those with lower risk prefer plans that trade higher out-of-pocket limits for lower deductibles and coinsurance. Consistent with this theory, I find empirical evidence in the ACA Individual Exchange that (1) there is significant variation in plan design (i.e., level of out-of-pocket risk) across plans in the same coverage tier, and (2) the straight-deductible plans attract enrollees with higher risk. I consider the implications of sorting on plan design for efficiency and market regulation using simulations. I show that regulating away complex plan designs could have large negative effects in an otherwise unregulated competitive market. Further, in risk-adjusted markets such as the ACA Exchanges, limiting complex plan designs would likely not have large benefits unless consumer confusion plays an important role in choices.  </p>

		<h2>Dominated Options in Health-Insurance Plans</h2>
	<p>with Justin Sydnor. Revise and resubmit at <i> American Economic Journal: Economic Policy </i> </p>
	<p> <a href= "https://www.nber.org/papers/w24392" target="_blank">[NBER Working Paper 24392]</a> <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/why-choose-wrong-health-plan.html" target="_blank">[The New York Times Coverage]</a> </p>
		<p> Prior research documents that there are sometimes dominated options in health plan menus, but is that common? We analyze Kaiser Family Foundation data on health plans that firms offer to their employees. For firms offering both a high-deductible and lower-deductible health plan, 62% of the time the high-deductible option has lower maximum spending risk for the employee. We estimate that the high-deductible plan dominates at roughly half of firms. We identify adverse-selection pricing as a likely mechanism for these surprising patterns and discuss implications for our understanding of the value of plan choice in employer-sponsored health insurance. </p>

  		<h2>Consolidation for Cost Savings? Hospital Mergers and Service Repositioning</h2>
		<p> with <a href= "https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/" target="_blank">Yu Ding</a>  <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WG1lNP8MmffwbnDtiPu6ArohQ6sBZZyh/view" target="_blank">[Draft: Nov 2019.]</a></p>
		<p> This project studies whether hospitals consolidate duplicative services to save costs. When confronted with antitrust challenges, hospitals seeking mergers frequently claim that they would gain substantial cost savings by consolidating their service to achieve economies of scale. We empirically explore hospitalsâ€™ post-merger service repositioning using a Difference-in-Differences research design. Our data come from the American Hosptial Annual Survey, the California Hospital Discharge and Financial Data. We find that targets and acquirers located within 10 kilometers of each other reduce approximately 2.5 (11%) of their duplicative services. For these adjacent merged hospitals, we observe a 10% increase in their HHI of volumes across services. Compared to non-consolidated services, the consolidated services experience a reduction of normalized patient care costs in the magnitude of 0.25 standard deviation. However, these effects disappear if merged hospitals are geographically distant. These findings identify a mechanism through which horizontal consolidations generate cost savings, but only applies to the geographically closed merged facilities. </p>

		<h2>Financial Incentive and Physician Treatment Decisions: Evidence from Lower Back Pain</h2>
		<p> with <a href= "https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/" target="_blank">Yu Ding </a> </p>
		<p> Value-based care has increasingly received attention in the policy debate of reducing health care spending. This paper empirically studies a specific form of payment model: capitated payment models. The physicians under capitated payment are paid a fixed amount regardless of the care spending generated. Using a large employer-sponsored health insurance claim database in the U.S. from 2003 to 2006,  we examine whether the capitated payment effectively motivates physicians to adopt low-cost treatments in the context of lower back pain. To mitigate selection concerns, we leverage capitation variation within an insurer and control for insurance-plan type fixed effects. After doing that, patients treated by capitated primary care physicians are similar to other patients in terms of pre-existing conditions. However, they are significantly more likely to receive therapy treatment than surgical treatment. They also have lower total medical expenses and out-of-pocket costs.  </p>
