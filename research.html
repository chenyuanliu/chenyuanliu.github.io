			<h2>Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>

		  		<p>Should health insurance plans be standardized? This paper explores both theoretically and empirically the implications of allowing multiple cost-sharing attributes for the functioning of health insurance markets. I develop a model of insurance choice with contracts varying in both the coverage level and the variance of uninsured losses. The model predicts that under asymmetric information, individuals with different health risks will demand plans with different designs, generating a force for plan variation even in markets that regulate the average level of coverage. I test for this type of selection on plan design in the ACA Exchange and find that a) cost-sharing variations within coverage tiers create significant differences in the risk protection to consumers and b) consumers sort differentially by health status in ways consistent with the theoretical predictions. I show that the consequences of regulating away design variation within coverage tiers depend on the extent of risk adjustment regulations and consumer confusion in the market. </p>

  			<h2>Hospital Mergers and Service Repositioning</h2>
				<p>with <a href= "https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/" target="_blank">Yu Ding</a>. <a href= "https://chenyuanliu.github.io/files/HospitalServiceRepositioning_DingLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</p>
				<p>Horizontal mergers are often associated with product reshuffling, which may have important anti-trust consequences. This article shows that hospitals merging with local competitors reposition service lines after the merger. We use hospital-level service lists data from American Hospital Association 2002 - 2012. To avoid endogenous selection into mergers, we estimate difference-in-differences models comparing hospitals merged later to those merged earlier. We find that merging hospitals eliminate duplicate services without reducing patient volumes. Hospitals within a system become more differentiated in service positioning after the merger. However, there is limited evidence that repositioning leads to significant cost reductions.</p>

			<h2>Does Allowing Greater Health Plan Variety Increase Enrollment? Evidence from the ACA Actuarial Value Rule Change</h2>
				<p>with Thomas DeLeire. Draft available upon request. </p>
				<p> The 2017 Market Stabilization Rule changed the de minimus range in actuarial value (AV) of most plans offered on the individual market from -2/+2 percentage points to -4/+2 percentage points. In 2018 and 2019, Marketplace plans in states using the HealthCare.gov platform reflected this expanded AV range, with almost 25% of plans having AVs more than 2 percentage points below their target AV. These lower AV plans had correspondingly lower premiums, and each percentage-point decline in AV was associated with a $5.70 lower premium for a 27-year-old non-smoker. AVs of Benchmark plans also declined, leading to a $1.41 decline in the Benchmark premium and $1.12 decline in the average premium subsidy for each percentage-point decline in the AV of the Benchmark plan. There were greater declines in enrollment in areas and among insurance products that used the expanded AV range to a greater extent, and most of these enrollment declines were the result of reductions in premium subsidies. Our estimates imply that eliminating this rule would lead to increased benchmark premiums, premium tax credits, and Marketplace enrollment. </p>
