			<h2>Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>

		  		<p>Health insurance plans often have multi-dimensional cost-sharing features, including deductibles, coinsurance rates etc. In this paper, I show that under asymmetric information, the desire of the low risk types to avoid pooling with higher risk types create proliferation of plan designs: high risk types who are more likely to experience large losses prefer plans with a straight-deductible, while low risk types who are more likely to have no or small losses prefer plans with coinsurance for smaller losses and large maximum out-of-pocket. As a result, allowing for multidimensional contracts reduce the welfare loss from asymmetric information. Consistent with the theory, I show that in the ACA federal exchange, where multi-dimensional design is allowed, there is large variation in plan designs, and that straight-deductible plans attract individuals with significant higher ex- post medical spending and ex-ante risk scores. I simulate the potential welfare effects of removing the plan design variation.</p>

  			<h2>Hospital Mergers and Service Repositioning</h2>
				<p>with <a href= "https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/" target="_blank">Yu Ding</a>. <a href= "https://chenyuanliu.github.io/files/HospitalServiceRepositioning_DingLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a></p>
				<p>Horizontal mergers are often associated with product reshuffling, which may have important anti-trust consequences. This article shows that hospitals merging with local competitors reposition service lines after the merger. We use hospital-level service lists data from American Hospital Association 2002 - 2012. To avoid endogenous selection into mergers, we estimate difference-in-differences models comparing hospitals merged later to those merged earlier. We find that merging hospitals eliminate duplicate services without reducing patient volumes. Hospitals within a system become more differentiated in service positioning after the merger. However, there is limited evidence that repositioning leads to significant cost reductions.</p>
