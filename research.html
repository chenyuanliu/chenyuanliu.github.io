  		<h2>Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>
  			<p>This paper identifies an underappreciated dimension of sorting in health insurance: sorting by plan design. Health insurance plans often have multi-dimensional cost-sharing attributes that can vary across plans with the same expected level of coverage. Classic theory suggests that plans with optimal risk protection have a straight-deductible design. I show that under community-rated prices, only high-risk types will sort into such plans. The low-risk types will prefer plans that trade-off higher maximum out of pocket (MOOP) for lower deductibles because, holding fixed the premium level, such plans provide more expected coverage to them (but also more variance in out-of-pocket expenditure). </p>
			<p>Consistent with theory, I find that ACA markets a) are populated with plans with very different levels of risk protection within the same coverage tier and b) high MOOP plans appear to attract healthier enrollees. I discuss conditions under which regulations to standardize plans will improve welfare, and I estimate the potential benefits of such policies. </p>

  		<h2>Consolidation and Service Repositioning in the Hospital Industry</h2>
		<p> with <a href= https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/>[Yu Ding] </p>
		<p> This project studies whether hospitals consolidate duplicative services to save costs. When confronted with antitrust challenges, hospitals seeking mergers frequently claim that they would gain substantial cost savings by consolidating their service to achieve economies of scale. We empirically explore hospitalsâ€™ post-merger service repositioning using a Difference-in-Differences research design. Our data come from the American Hosptial Annual Survey, the California Hospital Discharge and Financial Data. We find that targets and acquirers located within 10 kilometers of each other reduce approximately 2.5 (11%) of their duplicative services. For these adjacent merged hospitals, we observe a 10% increase in their HHI of volumes across services. Compared to non-consolidated services, the consolidated services experience a reduction of normalized patient care costs in the magnitude of 0.25 standard deviation. However, these effects disappear if merged hospitals are geographically distant. These findings identify a mechanism through which horizontal consolidations generate cost savings, but only applies to the geographically closed merged facilities. </p>
		
		<h2>Financial Incentive and Physician Treatment Decision: Evidence from Lower Back Pain</h2>
		<p> with <a href= https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/>[Yu Ding] </p>
		<p> Value-based care has increasingly received attention in the policy debate of reducing health care spending. This paper empirically studies a specific form of payment model: capitated payment models. The physicians under capitated payment are paid a fixed amount regardless of the care spending generated. Using a large employer-sponsored health insurance claim database in the U.S. from 2003 to 2006,  we examine whether the capitated payment effectively motivates physicians to adopt low-cost treatments in the context of lower back pain. To mitigate selection concerns, we leverage capitation variation within an insurer and control for insurance-plan type fixed effects. After doing that, patients treated by capitated primary care physicians are similar to other patients in terms of pre-existing conditions. However, they are significantly more likely to receive therapy treatment than surgical treatment. They also have lower total medical expenses and out-of-pocket costs.  </p>
