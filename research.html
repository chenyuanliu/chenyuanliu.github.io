  		<h2>Sorting on Plan Design: Theory and Evidence from the ACA</h2>
			<p> Draft: <a href= "chenyuanliu.github.io/files/DesignSorting_ChenyuanLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[Mar 2021]</a> <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSI4URrvsC4&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">[Video Presentation] </a></p>
  			<p>Should health insurance plans be standardized? This paper explores both theoretically and empirically the implications of allowing multiple cost-sharing attributes for the functioning of health insurance markets. I develop a model of insurance choice with contracts varying in both the coverage level and the variance of uninsured losses. The model predicts that under asymmetric information, individuals with different health risks will demand plans with different designs, generating a force for plan variation even in markets that regulate the average level of coverage. I test for this type of selection on plan design in the ACA Exchange and find that a) cost-sharing variations within coverage tiers create significant differences in the risk protection to consumers and b) consumers sort differentially by health status in ways consistent with the theoretical predictions. I show that the consequences of regulating away design variation within coverage tiers depend on the extent of risk adjustment regulations and consumer confusion in the market. </p>

		<p> Prior research documents that there are sometimes dominated options in health plan menus, but is that common? We analyze Kaiser Family Foundation data on health plans that firms offer to their employees. For firms offering both a high-deductible and lower-deductible health plan, 62% of the time the high-deductible option has lower maximum spending risk for the employee. We estimate that the high-deductible plan dominates at roughly half of firms. We identify adverse-selection pricing as a likely mechanism for these surprising patterns and discuss implications for our understanding of the value of plan choice in employer-sponsored health insurance. </p>

  		<h2>Consolidation for Cost Savings? Hospital Mergers and Service Repositioning</h2>
		<p> with <a href= "https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/" target="_blank">Yu Ding</a>.  Draft: <a href= "https://chenyuanliu.github.io/files/HospitalServiceReposition_DingLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[Aug 2020]</a></p>
		<p> When confronted with antitrust challenges, hospitals seeking mergers frequently claim substantial cost savings from consolidating their services to achieve economies of scale. This paper explores whether merging hospitals eliminate duplicate services to save costs. We use the California Patient Discharge Data and Hospital Financial Report, and employ a difference-in-differences research design. We find that targets and acquirers located within 10 miles of each other eliminate about five duplicate services on average. These adjacent merging hospitals also become more specialized in their service offering, with the volume concentration measurement (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) across services increasing by 10%. Compared to non-merged hospitals, the merging hospitals experience a 20% reduction in per-unit patient care costs for the consolidated services, a slight increase in patients' travel time, and no change in unexpected readmission rates. Service consolidation is not observed in more distant mergers. These results are robust to different service measurements and control strategies. </p>

		<h2>Financial Incentives and Physician Treatment Decisions: Evidence from Lower Back Pain</h2>
		<p> with <a href= "https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/yu-ding/" target="_blank">Yu Ding</a>. Draft: <a href= "chenyuanliu.github.io/files/CapitationLBP_DingLiu.pdf" target="_blank">[Jan 2021]</a></p>
		<p> In response to the high cost of health care, the capitated payment model has become more popular in recent years. Under capitation, physicians are compensated a fixed amount per patient regardless of the services generated. We provide new evidence on how the capitation payment model changes physician behavior by studying the treatment of lower back pain, a treatment type that has a lot of leeway for physicians’ discretion. We use data from 2003 to 2006 from a large employer-sponsored health insurance claim database, and we leverage capitation variation within the plan and physician to mitigate selection concerns and isolate impacts from other supply-side cost containment strategies. We find that the treatment intensity—mainly from therapy, diagnostic testing, and drugs—of patients under a capitation system is 12% lower than otherwise similar patients in a non-capitated plan. We also find no evidence of increased readmission rates for patients in a capitated plan. </p>
